## Using

~~~
wp find <path> [--skip-ignored-paths] [--include_ignored_paths=<paths>] [--max_depth=<max-depth>] [--fields=<fields>] [--field=<field>] [--format=<format>] [--verbose]
~~~

Recursively iterates subdirectories of provided <path> to find and
report WordPress installations. A WordPress installation is a wp-includes
directory with a version.php file.

Avoids recursing some known paths (e.g. /node_modules/, hidden sys dirs)
to significantly improve performance.

Indicates depth at which the WordPress installations was found, and its
alias, if it has one.

```
$ wp find ./
+--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+--------+
| version_path                         | version             | depth | alias  |
+--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+--------+
| /Users/wpcli/wp-includes/version.php | 4.8-alpha-39357-src | 2     | @wpcli |
+--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+--------+
```
